# Camera-Calibration-Project

# Overview

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the project I worked on in high school for calibrating a camera and finding the distance from it to an object (Aruco marker/Charuco marker) in the real world. It served as the basis to introduce me to computer vision,
and I used the same principles in this project when doing object detection and tracking for my FRC team's robot. All references for the code can be found at the top of each source code file.
* This project was written in Python using the OpenCV and numpy libaries.

# What I Learned

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project was what really got me excited about pursuing computer science, and more specifically artifical intelligence (though I am interested in other fields now too). At the time, I only had little experience
coding in Python, so this was my first real Python project. Additionally, I had never used any external libraries before. The OpenCV tutorials were very helpful for writing a lot of the code and explaining its purpose. Overall, I gained 

#Issues

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The code is not well commented or easily readable.
